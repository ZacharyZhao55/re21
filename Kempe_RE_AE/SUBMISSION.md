# Submission Details for RE 2021 Artifact Evaluation Track

## Requested Badges

We are requesting the Artifacts Reusable badge.  The interview guide includes
all questions used throughout our study, explications of the rationales for
these questions, a goal-oriented list of the data collected from each question,
and our complete coding scheme used during the analysis of the data collected
from the interviews.  We believe this is enough to easily facilitate
replication or reproduction of our work in addition to serving as a reasonable
starting point for a similar interview study.
