### Summary of Artifacts

In this dataset, we present 152 articles from the Requirements Engineering Education literature. We provide an Excel .xlsx file with the metadata and classification for each paper. We also include a bibtex file for convenience of the reader and future authors. Included in our classifications are spreadsheets for analysis of (1) publication year, (2) research methods, (3) academic level of observed learners, (4) educational approaches, and (5) learning outcomes. This dataset includes graphs and counts of reported numbers for easy verification for the associated publication(s) (see comments below).

### Description of Artifacts

Requirements Engineering (RE) has established itself as a core software engineering discipline. It is well acknowledged that good RE leads to higher quality software and considerably reduces the risk of failure or exceeding budgets of software development projects. Therefore, it is of vital importance to train future software engineers in RE and educate future requirements engineers to adequately manage requirements in various projects. However, to date there exists no central dataset for RE Education articles. To lay the foundation for this important mission, we conducted a systematic literature review. In this dataset, we present 152 articles from the Requirements Engineering Education literature. We provide the metadata, references, and our classification for each paper. We hope this dataset can be used by other researchers to advance the field of RE Education.
