### Requested Badges

- Available: We believe our artifact deserves the Available badge because it is publicly available and citable via DOI and institutional repository (see below).
- Reusable: We believe our artifact deserves the Reusable badge because it is the most complete set of RE education research literature from 1988 to 2020 available thus far, allowing other researchers and educators to search articles by type, contribution, and content. This will enable them to quickly gain an overview over the state of the art and select educational approaches suitable for their needs.
- Reproduced: We believe our artifact deserves the Reproduced badge because we strictly adhered to Kitchenham's literature search guidelines and in part reproduced results from a previous study by Ouhbi et al. (see our pre-print paper below)
- Replicated: We believe our artifact deserves the Replicated badge because in our RE'21 paper (see our pre-print paper), we provide details regarding the selection, inclusion, exclusion, and classification process to replicate our results despite the admittedly subjective nature of any literature search process.
